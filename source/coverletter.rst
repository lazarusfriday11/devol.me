My name is Pierce Devol,

I would love the opportunity to interview with you and your team to discuss your documentation needs in detail.
I come ready-to-go and am able to find and distill knowledge with minimal interaction or supervision.
Over the last four years I've launched 4 knowledge bases, 
authored controlled documentation for the FDA, 
created a runbook for a CEPH data cluster, 
and countless other documents for processes big and small.

I recommend you my portfolio website, generated through a static site generator and self hosted with my own domain with a clean and simple style.

https://devol.me

This website is designed using best docs-as-code practices.
It is edited in a simple text editor then synced to a shared git repository and the host.
At my website, you will find my resume and portfolio. 

I would also like to emphasize, 
that I have been working directly with IT departments doing tickets and learning from them for 6 years.
My knowledge is fresh and up-to-date. 
This breadth of experience allows me to ask questions that the experts may not have thought about;
and reduces the potential for lost knowledge. 
I love to meet you and your team and see if this would be a good match.

I Hope to hear from you,

Pierce Devol
