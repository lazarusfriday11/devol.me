Onboarding event
================

First week at new job as a Technical writer; 
I'm busy observing how things are done,

and now I'm watching an on-boarding session gone wrong.
"So Pablo, here is your username,"
"Here is your username."
The tech hands him the first time sign-in sheet.

The sheet reads:

    Username: pPabloDiegoJoséFranciscodePaulaJuanNepomucenoMaríadelosRemediosCiprianodelaSantísimaTrinidadRuizyPicasso@work.com"
    Password: *RandomSeriesOfCharacters*

He looked at it and said: 

"It was part of my hiring agreement that I could pick my own username. (recruiters will promise anything)
I refuse to type that for every login". It was clear that he was getting frustrated.
First day at a new job and already they are breaking promises? 
Certainly that is part of it, however his chosen username was a popular science fiction character.
I can't say it to give it away contextually, but you saw his affection for it.
You could tell that was the name he'd used on every forum since high school. 

And the conversation went on until eventually we made username for him after checking with HR.
This man was the latest member of our IT Security team. 
To my teams credit, they did check with recruiting and recreated the accounts without protest, 
He was allowed to take his desired username ppicasso@work.com

Pablo's boss on several occasions brush Even an IT Security guy from the previous anecdote, who fought for his unique username, 
later encouraged me to stick to generic example names lest we confuse people.

Even if they are not white and don't have a Christian name, you never hear anyone say anything about it.
Except for a conspicuous absence of active attempts to make the services and technology work for more than white guys. 
Even the racially diverse teams I worked with had no concern or focus on it. 

Establish Credibility
========================

Since then I've come to think about usernames quite a bit. 
The standard when creating usernames is first initial + last name @work.com;
every IT guy in a in a vacuum would pick that scheme for a companies computer infrastructure.
I would have too.

However before Before I became an IT guy then technical writer,
I was studying to be a minister like my mother.
I went to PLTS, a very very liberal Lutheran Seminary and member of the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley. 
While some of the academics were lacking, they did a good job of teaching diversity and anti-racism 
(get a copy of *A Different Mirror* by Ronald Takaki)

I did a clinical pastoral experience internship I watched people die, 
watched lives fall apart, and witnessed love like none other.
I saw the reality of domestic abuse. 
Oh boy did I see everything.

One day back in seminary, I decided I liked my computer hobby and fixing computers more then class.
I drop out of Seminary and drop into the IT world.
Now POC means Proof of Concept or Point of Contact, and not Person of Color.

I promise I've got another article in tank of on gender diversity.
But please excuse the use of the term *IT guy*, anyone who has worked with IT can tell you.
A major online retail company once announced its percentage of women in IT; it was 2%. 
Its a huge issue that deserves its own piece.

Why does tech not fit
=====================

As with any industry,
leadership is bread from the ranks.
IT people don't often pick non-IT people as leadership.
So they recruit from their ranks.
People who don't get a degree in IT, (most of them in my experience) start in IT Support.
These technically oriented individuals have few options to emphasise their soft or hard skills. 
If you are not smart enough to do advanced networking or DevOps work,
you go to management.

Then the decently technical person is in a position where his skills begin to atrophy. 
Once the technicals skills are finally decayed, you either have a diamond in the rough of a manager
or a frustrated out of date technician who can't turn down the salary and doesn't know a thing about people.
Sometimes they become director and pick the technology you will all use.
Non-people people picking stuff for people.

The issue isn't usability, most IT guys can look at a system and tell you if it will be user friendly or not.
The issue is comprised of a mosaic of small dehumanizing comprises that are made for technology.
Software companies see it, Slack now allows for skin tone and pronouns (though as a white guy, the skin tone thing sounds like at trap, but not the point). 
IT guys don't though they would just as soon pick better software that doesn't have these features.
And here we find ourselves with the limited pool and non-white lack of talent that Hollywood claims.
The leading competitor will have more business and still not include these features.
There are so many reasons why technology is not inclusive and I can't get into all of them.

In short, IT doesn't like exceptions;
we go to all this work to find the cheapest and best product and you want something that is more expensive because of 
of frilly extras about skin tone and pronouns?
No, its not necessarily the wrong decision;
that is the work of running a department.

But they add up. 

Tech must meet the people
=========================

    "We Chinese wish to say that the privilege of a mere typewriter is not tempting enough to make us throw into waste our 4000 years of superb classics, literature and history.
    The typewriter was invented to suit the English language, not the English language the typewriter."

    - Judging Eastern Things from Western Point of View, 1913

This quote was taken from the marvelous *The Chinese Typewriter, A history* by Thomas S. Mullaney.
This thought has become my inspiration, technology is made for people, and people are not made to suit technology.

In his book he discusses how there was a point in time where the Communist party was leading the way on ditching the Chinese alphabet,
while Chinese telegraph operators also learned enough English 
to make letters just to use morse code to send messages that would be translated back into Chinese.



At the same time comprises are made that benefit people beyond the goal:
The concept of radicals was made for the Chinese typewriter effort in Chinese in attempt to make a system to help in this endeavor.
Radicals are now a common tool in learning Character based east Asian scripts.
Hangul was handed down by Sejong the Great in the kingdom of Korea, to replace a smattering of nightmares Chinese based scripts.
Hangul is a super logical script, and you'd be surprised how fast you can learn Hangul
It opened the door for education to millions of poor Koreans; what greater gift could a ruler possibly give their people?

But people do meet technology, and we must find the balance. We all make comprises between our humanity and our technology.
Think programming *language*. And learning technologies' language has professional benefits.

Technology meets people
========================

We know this is not the case though.
IT and technology people write for people with names like John and Jane;
and these names are not expected to change *for any reason*.
Never mind if Jane takes another name.

IT is focused on the practical, how can we solve your problem?
What gets the user back to work fastest? 
This is a key metric for IT, recovered productivity.
We are not allowed the time to care about your *little* problems unless you are director or above.

hat I do know is what people named Mary Sue Parsons-Cummings  do not like to have to pick one "last" and one "first" name.
People from other cultures bristle at this, folks with names like Hee Sop Choi, don't exactly know what to pick.
So the IT guy often just picks something or makes a best effort.
Often there is no way or effort to get a hold of the new hire before the username must be created.
If you do not have a username on day one, they new user can't do anything.
You have to have something.
So guys name Ryan Johnson will make a best effort choose somthing like mcummings or hchoi.

However it turns out that No one calls her or knows her only as Mary Cummings, as that as added after she married her partner.
And Hee Sop Choi would rather have used his taken name of Danny,
the name he has used since me moved here with his parents at the age of 4 and perhaps he would never want to be known as simply Hee Choi. 

These objections are taken and handled on a case by case basis.
However, you are often out luck, they are the boss.
If it is changed after the account is created, 
you are almost guaranteed to have account issues as you continue through out your employment.
Keep that in mind ladies and gentlemen when decided on how you change or don't change names.


There is rarely a large motivation in IT to mix things up.
IT is about providing reliable service cost savings.
To ask massive companies reform, would I image, be cost prohibitive.
I've spent a lot of my professional life making usernames and passwords,
and it reminded me of a demonstrable trend: 
If you have a non Anglo-American name,
especially east or south Asian names,
it will be messed up.




I've had time to grow and reflectNow that I am task with finding names for a John Doe, I relfeect upon this and have made a syste where I use the equivalents of John and jane doe from other countries. 

So instead of John does we get Chan Tai man, Ashok kumar, and Fulano del tal. 

This provides us with several benefits:

_ It adds diversity that can be customized for the auience. In a software compnay with a large south asian population, I'll be sure to includ a few from india or pakistan.

- It gets IT guys thinking about names that are outsie the fn/ln paradigm. 

This one is rampant in IT, and I don't think it is intententional. IT guys, and I mean guys, often hold no higher education or a technical degree. Often times it is a professional degree or certification that comes from a ver narrow course of study. 

And very often these highschool grauate IT guys often had access to computers growing up. It isn't a stretch of the imagination to see that perhaps whites owned more computers than black and others people as a result of the econimic divide. Perhaps this is too much speculation

However I know that one can Say that TLDR most IT guys are white, nearly all IT guys are guys.


As such, the imperative of keep the computers running lead them to push everything to the side that gets in the way of upsetting the delectate balance of your companies IT infrastructure. 

So when it comes to making usernames they want a simple system to make a name for everbody. They pick the most obvious system:

First initial + last name = username

J{ohn) Doe becomes jdoe.
This is the default at most places, always exceptions of course.

But that last statement seems easy to brush off. But can it be so simply disposed of. I mean how often do people not have nammes that are fn last name (PS Most modern systems can easily work past this limitation, some however still only have two fields for names.)


So when I as an IT guy, who has untill this point, had very little experinece with Korean names, is force with a choice when presented with the name "Hee Sop Choi"

Several issues present themeselves:

- What is the obvious abbreviation? HSopchoi? hschoi, hee sop choi itself would fit.

But only when this gentleman starts do you learn that he goes by the name kevin. At ths point the accounts are created and there is no going back.

Or say you are Thai and named Horatio Chacovarnmokol, are you expected to use the horrendously large hchacovarmonkol everythime.

To which I've heard this issue brushed off by reccomending technology to cope with it rather than desing the systems around people.

Technology should always meet the needs of  people not the otherway arounnd, I reccomend a book called the Chinese Typewriter for more information on this subject.


I' not ure if I'm making too big of a deal about this. How much oes it suck to have your name butchered in systems or being stuck wiht a lousy one. Was there a dehumanizing aspect to having your name cut off part way through,? Is that traumatizing enough to be of concern? I hear many just okay wiht it, but I hear others very frustrated by it.


HAnd it is not that there is a malicious kabal of white computer guys gate keeping;
just the same general ignorance you see with all-lives matter, missing the issue entirely.
Its an issue of education, and IT guys are all about the hard skills.

oEveryone has to adapt to it.
If the software does what the purchaser wants it to do, and it is very difficult to learn and use; guess what?
Enterprise software has to be sold to one person or committee that represents an entire organization and its needs.
incentive sing customer satisfaction.
Consumer software and apps and the like often charge the customer directly,
However, enterprise is a different story. 
In the consumer space, usability and accessibility are the name of the game for many products.
 hile in public school, I took many standardized tests.
One thing stuck with me that I know find a credit to its authors. 
In word problems or stories that needed a generic character,
They frequently picked a non-White name for the characters.
I remember there being names like *Seiko*, *Carlos*, and *Hassan*.
As a white male in elementary school in the 90's, 
who saw him self represented in every form of media,
I said to myself "Why don't they just use normal names?"
