You can use speed controls in the Vault video player to adjust the playback speed of videos.
Use the **-** and **+** on the speed controls surrounding the speedometer icon in bottom right corner of the video player.

       # Comment: *Ideally I'd have larger screenshot showing where the controls are in relationship to the player.
       I'm also not a fan of the poor contrast. If there was a screenshot with different colors.
       Perhaps a black screen, or another solid color, would help the icons pop visually.*  

Increase Video Speed

To increase playback speed:

* Click **+** to the right of the speedometer to increase speed. 
  
* The number next to the speed controls will increase.
 
Decrease Video Speed
=======================

To decrease playback speed:

* Click **-** to the left of the speedometer to decrease speed.

The current speed is listed next to the speed control icons. 
You can reset to default speed (1x) by refreshing the page.

Exercise notes
==============

I had the ability to take some extra time on this, so I took advantage of that.
I did an hour and a half worth of research on the site and interpreting the design document.
The initial summary, editing included, took me about the 30 minutes. 
The instructional segments took about 15 minutes, 
as they are essentially duplicates.
The *About Video Playback Speed* section took about 30 minutes. 
I was deciding whether or not to include it at all, 
as it was simply background information. 
I ultimately put it in to be consistent with the "About" sections that are present in much of the documentation on the support site.
